## Decompressing the Data

Decompression relies on the `7-zip` utility, which you can install in case you do not have it installed already.

- **On macOS**: `brew install p7zip` (assuming Homebrew for installation)
- **On Ubuntu**: `sudo apt install p7zip-full p7zip-rar`

To decompress the data files, run the `decompress.sh` script. 
This will extract all the weekly traffic data files as well as app configuration dataframe into a directory named `data`.
The clone size of this repository is about 6GB, however, after decompression, the size of the `data` directory will be around 52GB.

```bash
bash decompress.sh
``` 

## Workload Size

- More than 1.9 billion requests
- 1780 applications
- 62 days

## Information Included 

- Hashed Namespace
- Hashed Application Name
- Daily Application Configurations (see `app_configs.pickle`)
    - 'NamespaceHash'
    - 'AppHash'
    - 'AppContainerRequestCpu'
    - 'AppContainerRequestMemory'
    - 'AppContainerConcurrency'
    - 'AppMinScale': The minimum number of instances for the application. If set to 0 (default value), the application scales down to zero.
- Weekly Traffic Data (10 weeks, see `week_*.pickle`)
    - 'NamespaceHash'
    - 'AppHash'
    - 'NumEvents'
    - 'InvocationTimes': A list of size `NumEvents` containing the invocation timestamps (in seconds)
    - 'AppExecTimes': A list of size `NumEvents` containing the application execution times (in milliseconds)
    - 'TotalExecTimes': A list of size `NumEvents` containing the total execution times (in milliseconds)
    - 'PodHash': A list of size `NumEvents` containing the pod hashes. Each app can have multiple pods, so this column allows to identify which pod served which request. Note that the ordering of requests across the these four lists is consistent.

## Using the Data

All data is stored in pickle format and should be loaded using Python Pandas library as DataFrames.

```python
import pandas as pd
df_configs = pd.read_pickle('data/app_configs.pickle')
df_week1 = pd.read_pickle('data/week_1.pickle')
...
```

Loading all the weekly traffic data files will require a high amount of RAM. 
Depending on your machine's capabilities, you might want to load part of the data or process the data in chunks.

## Using the Sample Scripts

We provide some sample scripts to help you get started with the data.
Before running the scripts, run the following command to create a virtual environment and install the required packages.

```bash
bash setup.sh
``` 

The sample scripts are located in the `sample-scripts` directory. You would have to run the sample scripts with the `sample-scripts` as your working directory.
